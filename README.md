## 🚀 What This Notebook Does

The notebook performs the following data cleaning and preprocessing steps:

- Load the Zomato dataset
- Drop unnecessary columns
- Rename columns for clarity
- Handle missing values
- Convert data types
- Normalize text casing
- Export the cleaned data to a CSV file

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive coding

---

## 🧼 Sample Cleaning Actions

- Fixes inconsistent column names
- Drops redundant columns like URLs, phone numbers, etc.
- Cleans up cost-related and rating columns
- Handles missing values with appropriate strategies
- Converts column data types to suitable formats
- Corrects textual casing for uniformity
